# Deployment Guide

## **Pre-requisites**

To deploy this solution, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions at the subscription and/or resource group level.

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available:

- [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry)
- [GPT Model Capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models)
- [DALL-E 3 Model Capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#dall-e-models)
- [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
- [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/)
- [Azure Container Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/)
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/)

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

### **Important Note for PowerShell Users**

If you encounter issues running PowerShell scripts due to the policy of not being digitally signed, you can temporarily adjust the `ExecutionPolicy` by running the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

This will allow the scripts to run for the current session without permanently changing your system's policy.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>[Optional] Quota Recommendations</b></summary>

By default, the **GPT-4o-mini model capacity** in deployment is set to **30k tokens**, so we recommend updating the following:

> **For GPT-4o-mini - increase the capacity to at least 150k tokens post-deployment for optimal performance.**

> **For DALL-E 3 - ensure you have sufficient capacity for image generation requests.**

Depending on your subscription quota and capacity, you can adjust quota settings to better meet your specific needs.

**⚠️ Warning:** Insufficient quota can cause deployment errors. Please ensure you have the recommended capacity or request additional capacity before deploying this solution.

### Deploying with AZD

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers), or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure by following the steps in the [AZD Deployment Guide](AZD_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Post Deployment Steps

1. **Add App Authentication**
   
    Follow steps in [App Authentication](./AppAuthentication.md) to configure authentication in app service. Note: Authentication changes can take up to 10 minutes.

2. **Assign RBAC Roles (if needed)**

    If you encounter 401/403 errors, run the RBAC assignment script and wait 5-10 minutes for propagation:

    ```shell
    bash ./scripts/assign_rbac_roles.sh
    ```

3. **Deleting Resources After a Failed Deployment**  
    - Follow steps in [Delete Resource Group](./DeleteResourceGroup.md) if your deployment fails and/or you need to clean up the resources.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary><b>Common Issues and Solutions</b></summary>

### 401 Unauthorized Errors

**Symptom**: API calls return 401 errors

**Cause**: Missing RBAC role assignments

**Solution**: Run `assign_rbac_roles.sh` and wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

### 403 Forbidden from Cosmos DB

**Symptom**: Cosmos DB operations fail with 403

**Cause**: Missing Cosmos DB data plane role (not ARM role)

**Solution**: Use `az cosmosdb sql role assignment create` (not `az role assignment create`)

### SSE Streaming Not Working

**Symptom**: Long responses timeout, no streaming updates

**Causes**:
1. HTTP/2 enabled on App Service (breaks SSE)
2. Proxy timeout too short

**Solution**:
```bash
az webapp config set -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n <app-name> --http20-enabled false
```

### Backend Not Accessible

**Symptom**: Frontend cannot reach backend API

**Cause**: VNet/DNS configuration issues

**Solution**:
1. Verify VNet integration is enabled on App Service
2. Verify private DNS zone is linked to VNet
3. Verify A record points to correct ACI IP
4. Check if ACI IP changed (run `update_backend_dns.sh`)

### Image Generation Not Working

**Symptom**: DALL-E requests fail

**Cause**: Missing DALL-E model deployment or incorrect endpoint

**Solution**: 
1. Verify DALL-E 3 deployment exists in Azure OpenAI resource
2. Check `AZURE_OPENAI_DALLE_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_DALLE_DEPLOYMENT` environment variables

</details>

## Sample Prompts

To help you get started, here are some **sample prompts** you can use with the Content Generation Solution:

- "Create a product description for a new eco-friendly water bottle"
- "Generate marketing copy for a summer sale campaign"
- "Write social media posts promoting our latest product launch"
- "Create an image for a blog post about sustainable living"
- "Generate a product image showing a modern office setup"

These prompts serve as a great starting point to explore the solution's capabilities with text generation, image generation, and content management.

## Architecture Overview

The solution consists of:

- **Backend**: Python 3.11 + Quart + Hypercorn running in Azure Container Instance (ACI) with VNet integration
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Fluent UI running on Azure App Service with Node.js proxy
- **AI Services**: 
  - Azure OpenAI (GPT model for text generation)
  - Azure OpenAI (DALL-E 3 for image generation)
- **Data Services**:
  - Azure Cosmos DB (products catalog, conversations)
  - Azure Blob Storage (product images, generated images)
- **Networking**: 
  - Private VNet for backend container
  - App Service with VNet integration for frontend-to-backend communication
  - Private DNS zone for internal name resolution

## Security Considerations

1. **Managed Identity**: The solution uses system-assigned managed identity instead of connection strings
2. **Private VNet**: Backend runs in private subnet, not exposed to internet
3. **RBAC**: Principle of least privilege - only necessary roles are assigned
4. **No Secrets in Code**: All credentials managed through Azure identity
